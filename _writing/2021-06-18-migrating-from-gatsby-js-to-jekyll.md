I'll migrate blog entries within a couple of days. This used to run on Gatsby.js, and now uses Jekyll (old skewl).

Jekyll does fewer things out-of-the-box, but it does them so well. It also uses Netlify CMS, which gave me alot of joy to tinker with. 

I typically write about everything that interests me - the tech I work with, random philosophical musings. Learning to learn better.

Alan Greenspan talked about *increased worker insecurity*. And how it made the American workforce more productive despite wage stagnation. I sometimes wonder if that's why new frameworks keep cropping up.

Testing: Did the updated GitHub oauth connection work? YESS

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

int main() {
  cout << add(5, 10);
}
{% endhighlight %}
