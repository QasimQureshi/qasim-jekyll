title: Using HEY email for a year
---
I remember feeling apprehensive paying money for email. It’s something I’d used to getting for free, for many years.

After a year of using HEY though, I don’t think I’d ever want to use free email again. Email is far too personal, to hand over control of, to some megacorp. It’s comforting when using HEY, that a relatively small startup built this, and they’re not in the business of selling consumer data. 

Web search, social media, email, these things cost millions of dollars to keep up. When advertisers pay the bills, tech startups end up oriented towards servicing their interests, rather than the interests of free, non-paying users. Richard Stallman talks about the fundamental freedoms that are lost when our technology behaves maliciously.

Other than the business model itself, HEY seems pretty well-thought out. The interface is quick to navigate around with intuitive keyboard shortcuts. It aggregates all my attachments in one place, so I don’t have to rummage through various emails looking for the right file.

Long email threads sometimes have issues with Gmail. Our work email threads get pretty long, and rendering them seems to freeze Gmail for people. I just try to make new email threads if they start to get too long, to help with that. 

HEY World seemed surprising, using email as a publishing platform. I’m excited to see HEY shape up in the years to come!
