title: Migrated from Gatsby. Blog entries to follow.
categories: migration

The previous iteration of this ran on Gatsby.js, and this runs Jekyll integrated with Netlify CMS.

Jekyll does fewer things out-of-the-box, but it does them so darn well. It's wonderful! 

Alan Greenspan talked about *increased worker insecurity*. And how it made the American workforce more productive despite wage stagnation. I sometimes wonder if that's why new frameworks keep cropping up.

I haven't had the chance to migrate blog entries - I shall endeavor to do so during the upcoming week.
